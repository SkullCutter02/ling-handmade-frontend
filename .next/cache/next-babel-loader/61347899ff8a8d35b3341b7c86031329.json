React from \"react\";\n\nconst Information = () => {\n  return (\n    <React.Fragment>\n      <section>\n        <p className=\"text\">\n          We always hear people said, “You are what you eat.” One step further,\n          “You are what you use.’ Majority of people will turn to bottled liquid\n          soaps when they want to buy something to clean their hair, face and\n          body. It is undeniable that the over-the-counter bottled liquid\n          cleansers are very attractive. They claimed to have different\n          functions: moisturising, pore-refining, exfoliating, you name it. They\n          are also packaged nicely with different colour. However, you might not\n          know the truth behind it. <br /> <br />\n          Most bottled liquid cleansers contain harsh chemicals, synthetic\n          lathering agent such as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate ( SLS ) which is linked\n          to breast cancer and is a known hormone disrupter. Some also contain\n          Dimethicone which creates silky after-use feeling. As you know, skin\n          is the largest organ and numerous researches show that toxic chemicals\n          can pass through the porous skin and go into our bloodstream. Using\n          over-time, those toxic can be accumulated internally in our body and\n          poses long term threat to our health. <br /> <br />\n          Then you will ask,”If bottled liquid cleanser is harmful, why not\n          using commercially made soaps?” There are in fact distinct differences\n          between commercially made soaps and handmade soaps. <br /> <br />\n          Commercial soaps are made with hot process so that soaps can be\n          produced and used in a short period of time. Besides, glycerin ( a\n          humectant that attracts moisture from the air to the skin ) which is\n          produced naturally from the soap making process, is being extracted\n          and sold separately to the skin care making industry to make lotions\n          and creams. This leaves the commercial soaps with only cleansing\n          property. Besides, a lot of chemicals are being added to the\n          commercial soaps: hardening agent to increase the durability;\n          lathering agent to produce rich foam; PH stabilizer to balance the PH;\n          preservatives also to increase durability. All these chemicals are\n          harmful to our body. <br /> <br />\n          On the other hand, handmade soaps are made by using different\n          vegetable oils with cold process. It is due to this cold process that\n          the nutrients and vitamins of the vegetable oils can be preserved.\n          Besides, most handmade soaps are scented with essential oils derived\n          from plants and flowers which contain different skin-loving\n          properties. Other natural ingredients can also be added such as clays,\n          herbs, milk , eggs etc to produce different functions. <br /> <br />\n          Glycerin, the by-product in the soap making process, is maintained\n          completely in handmade soaps. It captures the moisture in the air and\n          forms a protective layer on the skin. This is the secret of the\n          nourishing property of handmade soaps. <br /> <br />\n          Apart from being good to ourselves, handmade soaps are environmental\n          friendly. The toxic chemicals in commercial liquid cleanser and soaps\n          flow back to the rivers and ocean. They cannot dissolved and will be\n          accumulated in the water. Worst still, the polluted water will\n          ultimately find their way back to our water system. On the other hand,\n          residual of handmade soaps are bio-degradable and will be dissolved\n          into water and carbon dioxide after 24 hours. As such, they pose zero\n          burden and threat to our planet. <br /> <br />\n          Handmade soaps can be tailor-made to suit different needs of different\n          people. It can done simply by varying the combination of vegetable\n          oils and the addition of other natural ingredients. <br /> <br />\n          The main reason why people refused to use soaps is because of the dry\n          feeling they have after using commercial soaps. If this is exactly the\n          reason why you still away from soaps, I would strongly recommend you\n          to pick up a piece of handmade soap and I can guarantee you will love\n          it. While the beneficial effects might not be seen instantly, if used\n          over time, the beneficial effect will be obvious and long lasting.\n          <br /> <br />\n          So why use LHM? At LHM, we use natural ingredients sourced from\n          reputable overseas suppliers. We would not compromise quality in order\n          to reduce manufacturing cost.
