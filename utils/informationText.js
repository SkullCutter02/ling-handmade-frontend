  "We always hear people said, “You are what you eat.” One step further,\n" +
  "          “You are what you use.’ Majority of people will turn to bottled liquid\n" +
  "          soaps when they want to buy something to clean their hair, face and\n" +
  "          body. It is undeniable that the over-the-counter bottled liquid\n" +
  "          cleansers are very convenient. They claimed to have different\n" +
  "          functions: moisturising, pore-refining, exfoliating, you name it. They\n" +
  "          are also packaged nicely, sometimes with bright colours. However, you might not\n" +
  "          know the truth behind it. <br /> <br />\n" +
  "          Most bottled liquid cleansers contain harsh chemicals, synthetic\n" +
  "          lathering agent such as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate ( SLS ) which is linked\n" +
  "          to breast cancer and is a known hormone disrupter. Some also contain\n" +
  "          Dimethicone which creates silky after-use feeling. As you know, skin\n" +
  "          is the largest organ and numerous researches show that toxic chemicals\n" +
  "          can pass through the porous skin and go into our bloodstream. Using\n" +
  "          over-time, those toxic chemicals can be accumulated internally in our body and\n" +
  "          poses long term threat to our health. <br /> <br />\n" +
  "          Then you will ask,”If bottled liquid cleanser is harmful, why not\n" +
  "          use commercially made soaps?” There are in fact distinct" +
  "          differences between the commercially made soaps and handmade soaps. <br /> <br />\n" +
  "          Commercially made soaps are made with hot process so that soaps can be\n" +
  "          produced and used in a short period of time. Besides, glycerin ( a\n" +
  "          humectant that attracts moisture from the air to the skin ) which is\n" +
  "          produced naturally from the soap making process, is being extracted\n" +
  "          and sold separately to the skincare industry to make lotions\n" +
  "          and creams. This leaves the commercial soaps with only cleansing\n" +
  "          property. Furthermore, a lot of chemicals are being added to the\n" +
  "          commercial soaps: hardening agent to increase the durability;\n" +
  "          lathering agent to produce rich foam; PH stabilizer to balance the PH;\n" +
  "          preservatives also to increase durability. All these chemicals are\n" +
  "          harmful to our body. <br /> <br />\n" +
  "          On the other hand, handmade soaps are made by using different\n" +
  "          vegetable oils with cold process. It is due to this cold process that\n" +
  "          the nutrients and vitamins of the vegetable oils can be preserved.\n" +
  "          Moreover, good quality handmade soaps are scented with essential oils derived\n" +
  "          from plants and flowers which contain different skin-loving\n" +
  "          properties. Other natural ingredients can also be added such as clays,\n" +
  "          herbs, milk, eggs etc to produce different functions. <br /> <br />\n" +
  "          Glycerin, the by-product in the soap making process, is maintained\n" +
  "          completely in handmade soaps. It captures the moisture in the air and\n" +
  "          forms a protective layer on the skin. This is the secret of the\n" +
  "          nourishing property of handmade soaps. <br /> <br />\n" +
  "          Apart from being good to ourselves, handmade soaps are environmental\n" +
  "          friendly. The toxic chemicals in commercial liquid cleansers and soaps\n" +
  "          flow back to the rivers and ocean. They cannot be dissolved and will be\n" +
  "          accumulated in the water. Worst still, the polluted water will\n" +
  "          ultimately find their way back to our water system. On the other hand,\n" +
  "          residual of handmade soaps are bio-degradable and will be dissolved\n" +
  "          into water and carbon dioxide after 24 hours. As such, they pose zero\n" +
  "          burden and threat to our planet. <br /> <br />\n" +
  "          Handmade soaps can be tailor-made to suit different needs of different\n" +
  "          people. It can be done simply by varying the combination of vegetable\n" +
  "          oils and the addition of other natural ingredients. <br /> <br />\n" +
  "          The main reason why people refused to use soaps is because of the dry\n" +
  "          feeling they have after using commercial soaps. If this is exactly the\n" +
  "          reason why you turn away from soaps, I would strongly recommend you\n" +
  "          to use handmade soap and I can guarantee you will love\n" +
  "          it. While the beneficial effects might not be seen instantly, if used\n" +
  "          over time, the beneficial effect will be obvious and long lasting.\n" +
